# Car Dealership App

A mock car dealership e-commerce store for practice with React and NextJS. The homepage is very placeholder only because I couldn't think of what an online car dealership would possibly on a homepage. Feel free to send me suggestions on designs that could be improved. Majority is custom components with a few material-ui components mixed in.
